The basics of what you need to know:
    *You will be creating a shared repo for your final project, that will be coded
        in the main branch by default. (Imagine a tree, the main branch is the trunk)

    *You CANNOT all be making changes to that main branch at the same time, this will
        create errors, as github's entire job is to make sure that you are not overriding
        and creating conflicting files

    *The most simple solution to this is for you to have a main folder that contains the
        current version of the code, and to create folders for each individual group member
        to work in. Then, you can manually copy & paste the code you want into that main folder
        which ensures that everyone can be working on code at the same time, but you won't 
        get any conflicts

    *The more advanced solution to this is to create branches off the main branch, where you can code on 
        your own, experiment, change things, etc. This is like a branch off the main trunk. It allows you 
        to edit & update the main coding file. When you have finished the changes you wanted to make, you simply
        create a pull request. The owner of the repo then will review the changes as accept, or reject, anything
        before it is merged with the original, main branch.
